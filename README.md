A detection system for lung cancer using a tagged transcriptome data
from both bronchial and nasal endothelial cells.
Sample data comes from a wide-reaching clinical trial entitled
"Airway Epithelium Gene Expression in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer (AEGIS)".
Participants are sampled from two multicenter studies,
AEGIS-1 and AEGIS-2,
consisting of patients from 28 centers from across the US and Canada.
Both datasets rely on similar micro-RNA sequencing chips,
so the results of the two can be compared,
as cigarrette smoking causes abnormalities in gene expression
in both bronchial and the more easily-obtainable nasal endothelial cells.
